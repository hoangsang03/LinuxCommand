This error is telling you that the **build process doesnâ€™t have permission to delete (unlink) a file** inside your projectâ€™s `dist` folder:

```
EACCES: permission denied, unlink '/home/moniesaver/DailyLogApp/dist/assets/index-w_Cm0CFt.js'
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Breaking it down

* **`EACCES: permission denied`** â†’ Linux blocked the operation due to file permissions.
* **`unlink`** â†’ means "delete a file" in Unix terminology.
* **`/home/moniesaver/DailyLogApp/dist/assets/...`** â†’ the build process is trying to remove old build files before writing new ones.

---

### âš¡ Why it happens

1. **Wrong ownership/permissions**

   * Maybe you previously built as `root` or another user, so some files in `dist/` are owned by `root`.
   * Now your current user (`moniesaver`) doesnâ€™t have permission to remove them.

2. **Running inside Yarn Plugâ€™nâ€™Play (PnP)**

   * The `.pnp.cjs` in the trace shows youâ€™re using Yarn PnP, but the root cause is still **Linux file permissions**.

---

### âœ… How to fix

1. **Check file ownership**

   ```bash
   ls -la /home/moniesaver/DailyLogApp/dist/assets/
   ```

   If you see files owned by `root`, thatâ€™s the problem.

2. **Fix ownership** (make sure your normal user owns the project folder)

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R moniesaver:moniesaver /home/moniesaver/DailyLogApp
   ```

3. **Clean `dist` manually**

   ```bash
   rm -rf /home/moniesaver/DailyLogApp/dist
   ```

   Then rebuild.

4. **Avoid using `sudo` when running builds**

   * Always run `yarn build` or `npm run build` as your normal user, not `root`.

### ðŸ”‘ Summary

Your build process is failing because it **canâ€™t delete an old build artifact** due to ownership/permission mismatch.
Fix it by **resetting ownership of your project files** to your user and rerun the build.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to give you a **safe one-liner that resets all permissions for your project folder** (without breaking other system files)?
