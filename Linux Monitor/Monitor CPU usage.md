Let’s break down the output of your `free -h` command step by step:

```
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.8Gi       1.5Gi       143Mi       106Mi       2.5Gi       2.3Gi
```

---

### **1. total**

* `3.8Gi` → total RAM installed on your server (~3.8 GB).

---

### **2. used**

* `1.5Gi` → memory **actively used by processes**, but it **does not include cached/buffer memory**.

---

### **3. free**

* `143Mi` → memory **completely free / unused** by anything.
* Very low “free” is **normal** on Linux because Linux tries to use RAM for caching.

---

### **4. shared**

* `106Mi` → memory **shared between processes**, usually for tmpfs (in-memory filesystems).

---

### **5. buff/cache**

* `2.5Gi` → memory used by **buffers and caches**:

  * Buffers = temporarily used by kernel for I/O
  * Cache = filesystem cache to speed up disk access
* This memory can be **freed immediately if a process needs it**, so it’s not “lost memory”.

---

### **6. available**

* `2.3Gi` → memory **available for new processes** without swapping.
* This is the **important number**, not `free`. Even though “free” is only 143Mi, your system still has 2.3Gi that can be used.

---

### **Summary / Interpretation**

* You have 3.8 GiB RAM.
* ~1.5 GiB is actively used by programs.
* ~2.5 GiB is used for cache/buffers, which Linux can reclaim.
* ~2.3 GiB is available for new processes.

✅ **Your server is not running out of memory**. Low “free” memory is normal on Linux.

If you want, I can also explain **how to interpret this in real time while your MoneyManager API is running**, to see if it’s the cause of restarts. Do you want me to do that?
